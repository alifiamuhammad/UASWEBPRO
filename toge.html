          <p>TOGE PRODUCTIONS is an Indonesian based independent game development and publishing studio.
            We’re best known for games such as Infectonator, Relic of War, Days 2 Die, Necronator.
            
            Toge is an Indonesian word that means “bean sprout”. Here in Toge Productions, we believe that great accomplishments can start from small & simple beginnings, just like bean sprouts. Not only that, bean sprouts grow fast and quick to adapt too.
            
            <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
          In 2009, games development is both unknown and alien in Indonesia. At that time, Kris Antoni started making Flash games with a friend to earn some pocket money. Soon, they created a small game called Infectonator and it becomes a huge hit. What started as a hobby making Flash games soon evolved into something more serious for a couple of fresh grads in their bedrooms.</p>
